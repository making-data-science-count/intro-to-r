# An introduction to using R for data science (zero prerequisites required!)

This presentation is by [Joshua Rosenberg](https://joshuamrosenberg.com)

## Description

R is a freely-available, cross-platform, open-source programming language and statistical software environment that is well-suited to doing data science but can have a high barrier to entry. This KnoxData presentation aims to provides an introduction to using for data science, with a focus on developing a foundation in capabilities (and confidence!) that can be applied in a variety of data science contexts. It is open to anyone with an interest in R or data science. Most of the time will be spent on developing the following skills: a) Getting started with RStudio, b) and visualizing (with the ggplot2 R package), processing (with dplyr), and modeling data and presenting results (using a regression model), There are zero prerequisites, though, to get the most from the workshop, please bring your own laptop computer with you with R and RStudio installed.

## Installations

If you have issues with any of the installations below (and don’t worry, they’re all very small and won’t take up much space on your computer) please contact me ([staudtwi@msu.edu](staudtwi@msu.edu)) and I can try to work with you to get it resolved before the workshop. If we’re unsuccessful, at least we know from the start of the workshop that we’ll need to work with you to get up to speed.

## Interactive R Markdown File

`demo-doc.Rmd` is an interactive R Markdown file that accompanies the presentation.

## R Studio Cloud

An R Studio Cloud workspace/environment for the `demo-doc.Rmd` document in this repository is availabile here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/597547

This may be especially helpful if you do not yet have R and R Studio installed on your computer. It does require you to create an account or to use a Google (or GitHub) account to sign-in.
