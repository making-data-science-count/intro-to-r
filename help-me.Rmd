Here is code that can go in the code chunk after the following text in `explore-on-your-own-1.Rmd`:

> Almost there! Let's do the same for mentions; write code that will do this, starting with the `mentions` data frame, using the code above as an example. Consider which is the receiver and which is the sender for mentions.

```{r}
mentions <- mentions %>% 
  mutate(all_mentions= str_sub(all_mentions, start = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(interaction_type = "mentions") %>% 
  select(sender = from_user, receiver = interaction_type, interaction_type)
```
